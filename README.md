I had a lot of trouble connecting my SQL database to my backend, whenever I executed Update-Database it would give me an error saying:

"A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)"

I tried so many possible solutions and got input from proffesionals who work with c# but I could not figure out what was happening, maybe it's just my computer issue.
Regardless, if I were to successfully connect my database, the rest of my project should have worked.
